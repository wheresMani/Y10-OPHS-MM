#This is a comment 
#Variables Vs Constants 
#Variables are declared in titlecase
#CONSTANTS are declared in CAPITALS 

#Examples of Variables 

Team1Name = "Manchester United"
Team2Name = "Manchester United"

#Variables have a useful name 
#Variables store a value (can change)
#Variables can NOT start with a number
#e.g. 1TeamName = "Manchester United"
#This will cause a syntax error 

#Variables cannot have a space in the name 
#e.g. Team Name = "Manchester United"
#This will be a syntax error 

#This is an example of a CONSTANT 
FREETHROW = 1 
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3

#The values is a CONSTANT do NOT change
